# Lightweaver workboard

This is the compact cross-session source of truth. Only the primary agent edits
this file. Sub-agents return results, tests, commits, and blockers to the primary
agent, which integrates the evidence here. Keep entries short; detailed Bench and
Prove records belong in their session folders.

Status values: `queued`, `active`, `needs-eyes`, `blocked`, `done`.

## Sprint queue

| ID | Outcome | Area / likely ownership | Status | Focused proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WINDOWLESS-001 | Public Studio direct-LNA/local-origin transport, offline repository/PWA, and explicit project continuity | Studio source | done | 1,364 unit assertions + focused Chromium cold-offline pass |
| WINDOWLESS-002 | Card HTTP streaming, owner capability, atomic project storage, and embedded local Studio server | Firmware source | done | 4 focused contracts + generated-bundle PlatformIO pass |
| WINDOWLESS-003 | Card/PWA build targets, encrypted staging, release lanes, and integrated browser/artifact contracts | CI / release / browser tests | done | 8 tooling contracts + Pages staging + production/card builds |
| CONNECTION-001 | Show exact discovered-card identity and installed-versus-current firmware; turn direct-connect failures into evidence-based recovery | Studio source and focused browser contracts | done | 1,371 unit assertions + 29 Chromium connection/install scenarios + production build |
| CONNECTION-002 | Read the installed Lightweaver firmware identity directly and read-only from the USB card application partition | Studio USB installer and focused contracts | done | 19 focused assertions + 7 Chromium installer scenarios + production build |
| CONNECTION-003 | Replace the silent-card dead end with evidence-based network/firmware explanation and a same-tab USB check/update route | Studio connection center and installer plan | done | 15 focused assertions + 30 Chromium connection/install scenarios + production build |
| UPDATE-001 | Preserve Wi-Fi, projects, patterns, wiring, and settings through one USB bootstrap and subsequent signed A/B Wi-Fi updates | Studio, firmware, release tooling | done | Unit 1,392/1,392; Chromium 48/48; firmware 4/4; signed-release 29/29; Vite and PlatformIO builds |
| UPDATE-002 | Acknowledge the verification/restart phase immediately after a preserving USB write reaches the full signed byte count | Studio preserving updater and browser contract | done | 5 USB bootstrap assertions + 8 Chromium preserving-update scenarios + production build |
| UPDATE-003 | Start the first preserving Wi-Fi update with a valid exact-card authority, surface card refusal details, and place the compact update action under the build facts | Studio transport, preserving updater, and focused browser contract | done | Unit 23/23; Chromium 34/34; production build; desktop visual inspection |

## Active ownership

| Owner | IDs | Exact files / boundary | Started | Latest evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None | — | — | — | UPDATE-003 integrated and verified; real-card retry remains in the visual/Bench queue |

The primary assigns at most three sub-agents. Two active owners must never name
the same file or an inseparable behavior boundary.

## Visual-feedback queue

| ID | Screen or hardware state | What Adrian must observe | Build / fixture | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WINDOWLESS-VIS-001 | Direct Chrome/Edge local-network permission and exact-card control | Permission allow/deny/revoke, no auxiliary tab, correct lights and Stop | Real router + configured card | needs-eyes |
| WINDOWLESS-VIS-002 | Safari/iOS same-tab card-local Studio | Full routine flow on AP without internet, no auxiliary tab | iPhone/iPad + configured card | needs-eyes |
| WINDOWLESS-VIS-003 | Card serves embedded Studio while animating | First/repeated asset loads do not visibly stall animation; recovery page survives incompatibility | Real configured card | needs-eyes |
| UPDATE-VIS-001 | Preserving update in real Chrome/Edge | One USB bootstrap and later Wi-Fi update retain the exact card, project, Wi-Fi, settings, patterns, and visible light behavior | Configured card + real router | needs-eyes |
| UPDATE-VIS-002 | USB update after the full application byte count | Status changes to “Upload complete · checking the saved update,” then advances to restart/reconnect | Card `lw-b0fe81f61b44` + live Studio containing UPDATE-002 | needs-eyes |
| UPDATE-VIS-003 | First preserving Wi-Fi update action and refusal recovery | Compact action appears below build values; first start advances past owner pairing without HTTP 400 | Card `lw-b0fe81f61b44` + Studio containing UPDATE-003 | needs-eyes |

Visual feedback does not pause independent automated work. The primary returns to
this queue when Adrian is available.

## Bench queue

| ID | Goal | Machine state | Human input still required | Session | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BENCH-001 | Restore and re-verify the GPIO 18 bench card after the destructive factory flash | Firmware 1.1.1 build 1198, boot `boot-0bb7a7d8-b0fe81f61b44`, reachable at `192.168.18.70` and USB; Wi-Fi recovered but card is blank with no project/output | Resolve prior 41-pixel RGB evidence versus frozen 44-pixel GRB job, then observe the lights | Prove session `2026-08-10-windowless-offline-studio` | blocked |
| BENCH-UPDATE-001 | Prove preserving USB bootstrap, signed A/B Wi-Fi update, rollback, and interruption recovery on a configured exact card | Automated implementation and simulated browser contracts are green; no firmware was signed, flashed, or power-cut in this Sprint | Configure a known fixture, preserve before/after hashes and project evidence, then observe USB, OTA, reboot, rollback, power-loss, Stop, and lights | Not started | needs-eyes |
| BENCH-UPDATE-002 | Prove visible phase acknowledgement after the preserving USB application write completes | Card `lw-b0fe81f61b44` successfully restarted on 1.1.5 Build 1239 with station Wi-Fi preserved; local fix changes the silent readback interval to an explicit verification status | After the code fix ships, repeat once and report the first label shown after the byte count completes | `docs/bench-sessions/2026-08-10-lw-b0fe81f61b44-usb-update-feedback.md` | needs-eyes |
| BENCH-UPDATE-003 | Prove the first preserving Wi-Fi update can acquire exact-card authority and begin | Card `lw-b0fe81f61b44` remains healthy on 1.1.5 Build 1239; first Studio authority used forbidden generation 0 and hid the returned error | After UPDATE-003 is live, press one card control, start the compact Wi-Fi update once, and report the first phase or exact visible refusal | `docs/bench-sessions/2026-08-10-lw-b0fe81f61b44-wifi-update-400.md` | needs-eyes |

## Prove readiness

| Scope | Requested explicitly? | Development frozen? | Automated readiness | Hardware readiness | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full Lightweaver | Yes — `Prove Lightweaver` | Frozen through closed run — `ce1b9b3` / Studio 1224 / firmware 1223 | Incomplete: unchanged exhaustive gate 347/348; two deterministic Pattern Lab checks red | Card `lw-b0fe81f61b44` is blank on build 1198; 41-pixel RGB versus 44-pixel GRB fixture conflict | blocked |

“Ship” does not change this table to authorized. Only the explicit Prove gate in
`docs/workflows/prove.md` does.

## Completed evidence

| ID | Outcome | Evidence | Revision / build | Completed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WORKFLOW-001 | Proportional glitch/checkpoint/release workflow shipped | PR #96; live no-store marker | Studio build 1201; firmware release build 1198 | 2026-08-09 |
| WORKFLOW-002 | Inferred Sprint, guided Bench, and explicit Prove system implemented | Seven mode contracts plus resumable Bench/Prove templates | Branch `codex/three-mode-workflow` | 2026-08-09 |
| WINDOWLESS-001–003 | Windowless/offline Studio implemented across public PWA, card-local Studio, firmware, project storage, encrypted handoff, and release tooling | Unit 1,364/1,364; tooling 8/8; firmware 4/4; Chromium offline 1/1; Pages staging; Vite/card/PlatformIO builds | Local commit on `codex/windowless-offline-studio` | 2026-08-10 |
| PROVE-2026-08-10 | Full proof run closed `INCOMPLETE`; live bytes/signature/build graph pass, mandatory exhaustive and physical gates do not | `docs/prove-sessions/2026-08-10-windowless-offline-studio.md` | Studio 1224; firmware 1223; card actual 1198 | 2026-08-10 |
| CONNECTION-001 | Exact USB card identity and installed/current firmware comparison; evidence-based LAN, incompatible-firmware, and USB-loader recovery | Unit 1,371/1,371; Chromium connection 23/23; install/update 6/6; production build | Local Sprint checkpoint | 2026-08-10 |
| CONNECTION-002 | Direct USB application-partition firmware identity read, with strict Lightweaver envelope validation and no settings reads | Real signed v1.1.1/v1.1.3 image contracts; focused 19/19; Chromium 7/7; production build | Local Sprint checkpoint; real-card read remains Bench evidence | 2026-08-10 |
| CONNECTION-003 | No-response state explains that cause is unknown, offers USB firmware check/update, and recommends update when direct semver evidence proves it | Focused 15/15; Chromium connection/install 30/30; production build | Local Sprint checkpoint | 2026-08-10 |
| UPDATE-001 | Preserving firmware updates implemented: old cards get one app-only USB bootstrap; capable cards get signed inactive-slot Wi-Fi updates with exact-card/project correlation, rollback, bounded resume, and separated factory recovery | Unit 1,392/1,392; Chromium 48/48; firmware contracts 4/4; release contracts 29/29; Vite and ESP32-S3 PlatformIO builds | Local Sprint checkpoint; physical preservation and power-loss behavior remain Bench evidence | 2026-08-10 |
| UPDATE-003 | First preserving Wi-Fi update now uses a positive exact-card authority, accepts the exact blank-project head, surfaces the card's structured refusal, and places a quiet right-aligned action beneath the build values | Focused unit 23/23; Chromium preserving/connection 34/34; production build; desktop visual inspection | Local Sprint checkpoint; exact-card update retry remains Bench evidence | 2026-08-10 |

## Update rules

1. The primary adds or changes an entry when work is assigned, integrated,
   blocked, visually observed, or proven.
2. Keep exactly one active owner per file boundary.
3. Move detailed logs into a dated session file and link it; do not grow this
   board into a transcript.
4. Every interrupted Bench or Prove session records one and only one next step.
5. Completed entries name behavior and evidence, not agent activity.
